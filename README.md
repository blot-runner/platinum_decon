# platinum_decon
This mod adds disassemble (uncraft) recipes for platinum jewelry - for those rich survivors desiring to spend their ill-gotten fortune on crafting this coveted PLATINUM GRILLE. Temporary solution until PR with the same recipes is merged (if it is not, I'm not deleting this mod, but will probably stop maintaining it eventually... I'm lazy).
# How to use
1. To use this mod when creating a new world, put it in your mods folder. The mod will appear as "Platinum Deconstruction" in the default section when creating a world.
2. To use this mod with an existing world, put it in your mods folder. Then go to save\<YOUR WORLD NAME> in your cdda folder, locate mods.json file and add the mod name (platinum_decon) in quote marks to the list of your mods. Should be something like that:

[
  "dda",
  "no_npc_food",
  "mod_1",
  "mod_2",
  ...
  "mod_gazillion",
  "platinum_decon"
]

AND PLEASE REMEMBER ADDING MODS ATO AN EXISTING WORLD VOIDS YOUR WARRANTY AND CAN LEAD TO ANY UNFORSEEN CONSEQUENCES UP TO AND INCLUDING YOUR PC TURNING INTO ACTIVATED MININUKE! Seriously, you should be fine, but don't come to me with torches and pitchforks, if something goes wrong.

Enjoy!
